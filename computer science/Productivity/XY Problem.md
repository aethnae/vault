title: What is it?
The **XY problem** is asking about your attempted *solution* rather than your actual *problem*. This leads to enormous amounts of wasted time and energy, both on the part of people asking for help, and on the part of those providing help.
```


##### Example:
- User wants to do **X**
- User doesn't know how to do **X**, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do **Y**
- User doesn't know how to do **Y** either
- User asks for help with **Y**
- Others try to help user with **Y**, but are confused because **Y** seems like a strange problem to want to solve
- After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with **X**, and that **Y** wasn't even a suitable solution for **X**

The problem occurs when people get stuck on what they believe is the solution and are unable to step back and explain the issue in full.
