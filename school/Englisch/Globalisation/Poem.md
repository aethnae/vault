Ah, social media, what a treat, The platform that can't be beat, A world of likes and follows galore, But risks? Nah, we'll just ignore.

The trolls and haters, oh what fun, Toxic comments, we'll just run, Fake news and scams, no big deal, We'll just share and wait for the real.

Privacy? That's so last year, We'll just post without a fear, Our personal info up for grabs, What could go wrong? Let's just tag.

But wait, what's that? A data breach? Our info sold like a fruit on a beach, Our identities stolen, oh my, But hey, at least our selfies fly.

So let's keep scrolling, without a care, We'll just keep posting, it's so rare, That anything bad could happen to us, But if it does, we'll just make a fuss.

Social media, what a blast, We'll just keep posting, until the last, But beware the risks, they're all around, Or we might end up with a digital crown.
