- Mae is a perfectionist, so she can't stand the "chaotic mess in the developing world" (l. 89) her hometown and the rest of America is for her
- Due to this fact, she feels at home at *the circle*, a real-life-utopia
- Mae perceives the "outside" world as very inefficient, slow & chaotic - she prefers a collective system in which everything is optimised to the maximum

The circle is the blueprint of an utopian ecosystem inside the existing world with all its flaws. The excerpt offers multiple hints on why this thesis is accurate:
Even the introductory sentence of the text emphasises the existence of an utopian model - Mae describes the circle campus as "heaven" (l. 1).
Especially the paragraph from line 24 - 46 is full of hints that advertise an utopian reality: The inefficiency of many existing applications in the world wide web got replaced by an efficient, optimised and omniscient system. Line 50 leads to believe that the necessity of using your true identity only has a positive side: the eradication of identity theft & cyber crimes.
Even though critics were also present, they quickly got shut down by the large mass of users that enjoyed effectiveness and didn't care too much about anonymity and companies that sensed a boost in their marketing strategies (l. 61 - 70).
Although the excerpt is strongly persuasive and tries to advertise the idea behind *the circle*, there are clues that present the concept as dystopian: All the effectiveness that could be gained through centralisation comes with the loss of individual anonymity, as critics mentioned (l. 62).
The text fully ignores the basic rights that are to apply in the EU - every citizen has a right on freedom & privacy which can't be violated for profit.
