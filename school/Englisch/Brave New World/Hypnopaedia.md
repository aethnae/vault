I am happy to be a Delta.
I do not want to be part of any other caste.
I am proud to serve society as a member of my caste; all castes are necessary for our society to function.

I am happy to be a Delta.
My work is crucial - books and education would only distract me, not serve for a greater good.
Books are predestined for Alpha members of society. I am proud of their service.

I am happy to be a Delta.
Society itself can only function through collaborative work. All castes are necessary.
