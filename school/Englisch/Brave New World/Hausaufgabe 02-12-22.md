##### 1. What do you think is the reason that there aren't any books to read?
Education is limited to a pragmatic transfer of knowledge which is useful to society, that's why humanistic education is not desired. Any education based on cultural lore is suppressed, historical knowledge is only acquired through the official propaganda. This leads to the government of the World State being able to control the flow of information throughout society.

##### 2. Why does the World State say that "History is bunk"?
To be able to restrict the number of naturally conceived and born people to a minimum, so that the state does not lose control over the size of population, people are conditioned to view natural conception and parenthood as something indecent from barbaric times. 

##### 3. What is the purpose of the feelies?
Art and literature have been replaced by the "feelies", in which even physical sensation is is transmitted to the viewer. Due to emotional impoverishment of the audience and the accompanying incomprehension of sophisticated content, stories are trivial and without deeper meaning, and only serve to advertise controlled sexual reproduction.

##### 4. Why does the World State propagate promiscuity?
Societal norms require citizens to have numerous sexual contacts with continuously changing partners for the sole purpose of pleasure. Although women can also choose their changing sexual partners and reject men, promiscuity is almost always portrayed as a male preying on "beautiful" female bodies.

##### 5. Why does the World State give out soma?
To avoid major emotional disgruntlement throughout society, citizens are indoctrinated to consume soma, a drug that has mood-lifting and stimulating effects, which can also be used as an aphrodisiac (drug that lifts libido).

##### 6. Why is stability important?
To avoid the collapse of the totalitarian, yet non-violent system that prevails in society, stability is indispensable. A totalitarian system can only persist if it enforces the satisfaction of a large part of society.
