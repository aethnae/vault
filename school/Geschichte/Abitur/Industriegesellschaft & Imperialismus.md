Arguments about the causes and value of imperialism can be classified into four main groups:

- Economic arguments, e.g. does colonialism pay?
- Imperialism as a part of the natural struggle for survival, forming a connection to social darwinism
- Strategical arguments, justifying colonialism as a measure to prevent other states from gaining a monopoly in power and protecting their population
- Arguments based on moral ground, e.g. justifying colonialism as a missionary duty to bring a "superior" way of living to colonies

Imperialism results from a complex of causes in which in varying degrees economic pressures, human aggressiveness and greed, the search for security, the drive for power and prestige, nationalist emotions, humanitarianism, and many other factors are effective. This mixture of motivations makes it difficult to eliminate imperialism but also easy for states considering themselves potential victims to suspect it in policies not intended to be imperialistic. Some states of the developing world have accused the former colonial powers and other nations ofÂ **neocolonialism**. Their fear is that the granting of aid or the supply of skilled personnel for economic and technical development might be an imperialist guise.
