```timeline
+ Building of the Berlin Wall
+ 1961
+ This marked the temporary cessation of Adenauer's plans to reunite Germany: Social Democrats all over Germany proposed a course of rapprochement, seeking for reunification and peace.

+ Shift in Government
+ 1966
+ After Ludwig Erhard's rather conservative government coalition (CDU/CSU/FDP) failed in 1966, the newly founded "Grand Coalition" (CDU/CSU/SPD) started recognizing multiple eastern nations diplomatically.

+ Prague Spring
+ 1968
+ Invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact, sparking thousands of young workers in the GDR to protest.

+ New Eastern Policies under Brandt
+ 1969
+ Pursuance of so called "Ostpolitik" - the improvement of diplomatic relationships in eastern Europe through acceptance of post-war territorial losses, reduction of force in international affairs, and through the setup of multiple treaties:
- Moscow Treaty | Soviet Union | August 1970
- Warsaw Treaty | Poland | December 1970
- Basic Treaty | East Germany | December 1972
- Prague Treaty | Czechoslovakia | December 1973

This behavior enabled Germany to profit from free trade & diplomatic relations, which was crucial in the post-war period.

+ The German-German Basic Treaty
+ 1972
+ Marking the most controversial point in approchement policies, the Basic Treaty between the FRG and the GDR brought improvements to the daily life of many Germans: Families were able to visit relatives in East-Germany again, by using their cars on improved transit routes.
Critics stated that the Basic Treaty would basically recognize the GDR as another legal sucessor to the German Reich, which by definition of the "Basic Law", only the FRG was.

+ The End of the Era Brandt
+ 1974
+ GÃ¼nter Guillaume, one of Brandt's closest associates, was exposed as an East German spy in April 1974. Following the government crisis, Brandt was replaced with Helmut Schmidt, a man known for his pragmatism.
Under his reign, Germany took part in the "NATO-Doppelbeschuss", stationing nuclear weapons in Germany as a reaction to Russia's arms race.

+ Vote of No-Confidence
+ 1982
+ After many leftist party members of the SPD protested against the stationing of nuclear weapons, Helmut Schmidt lost a vote of no-confidence against Helmut Kohl, which resulted in a newly formed liberal-conservative government by the FDP & CDU/CSU.

+ East German Consolidation
+ 1963 - 1988
+ Opposing the market economy of Western Germany, the GDR tried to rely on planned economy, just as their communist idol in Russia did. Even after the ordered decentralisation by Walter Ulbricht, in hopes of increasing the workers' productivity, the GDR could never catch up to the living standard of the FRG.

+ Resignation of Ulbricht
+ 1971
+ After failing his goal of persuading the Soviet Union to insist on complete diplomatic recognition of the GDR internationally, Walter Ulbricht resigned and was replaced by Erich Honecker, who focused on strengthening the German-German relations & bettering the situation of the working class in East Germany.
