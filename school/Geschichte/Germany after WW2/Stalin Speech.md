Dear Comrades,

I was utterly shocked when hearing this unholy scramble for words, delivered by Winston Churchill earlier. How could he possibly disgrace the glorious red army like that; disown the great achievements of the Communist Party of the Soviet Onion.
To give him a small piece of advice: We are always interested in a peaceful solution, but only if you respect the god-given borders of the territory of *Rus*.
