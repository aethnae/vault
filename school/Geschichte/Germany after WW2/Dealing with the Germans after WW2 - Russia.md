One of the main points in which Stalin's policies over Germany differed from the policies issued by the US or Great Britain was his opinion, after which security over peripheral territory could only be achieved through oppression.
His end goal was to achieve Soviet influence over Eastern Europe, especially through the resurrection of Soviet borders as they were in 1941, ending in the re-capturing of polish territory, and the harsh governance over those.
Eventhough Stalin agreeing with the other allied powers on restricting Germany's future potential, he saw threats in capitalism, so he had to oppose the "other" allied powers.

##### Main points they could all agree on:
- Austria should be an independent country again
- Germany should be restricted from gaining power again, after getting completely destroyed in WW2
