**Pros:**
- Daily life improved for the majority of Germans after the treaties were signed
- Families from the FRG and GDR could visit again under some restrictions
- West Germans were allowed to drive their own cars during visits to the GDR

- Material improvement would lead to relaxing in foreign politics

**Cons:**
- Critics feared that the German-German Basic Treaty between the FRG and the GDR violated the Basic Law, which defined West Germany as the legal successor to the German Reich
- National Question was still open, and even got more unclear through the signing of these treaties
- CDU/CSU stressed the importance of the atlantic alliance with the USA, and feared it could be damaged if the FRG became a partner of the Soviet Union

**Assessement:**
- Free trade would open up the Eastern and the Western Zone to negotiations
