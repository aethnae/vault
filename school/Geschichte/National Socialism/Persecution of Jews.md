##### 1. Describe two ways in which Jews were persecuted up to 1935

**Restrictions against Jewish life in Germany**
- Boycott of Jewish shops and businesses; Jews were banned from government employment, medicine, teaching and journalism
- Jews were banned from public places and prohibited to enter the army in 1935

**Nuremberg laws**
- Jews were prohibited to marry Aryans in the motivation to control their reproduction
- Jews were restricted from voting & unable to hold a German passport

##### 2. Why/How did persecution get worse over time?

Up until 1935, most Jews were still able to emigrate out of Germany without a problem - the "Reich Office for Jewish Emigration" was set up and was responsible for speeding up the process. Many Jews chose this option, as life in Germany became more and more uncomfortable for them: They were slowly made unable to run a business in Germany, they were banned from public places in 1935, and they were prohibited to hold a German passport.
After 1939, the situation worsened a lot, and all the remaining Jews in Germany (many were still around, as other countries did not accept their visa, fearing competition with local workers) had to suffer much more than before. From 1938/1939 onwards, Jews had to register all goods with the government, making them vulnerable to seizings by the Nazis, carry identity cards with them, and were set under further restrictions, making doctors and lawyers unable to work.
By 1942, the "last" major switch in Nazi policy happened: The **genocide**, during which the Jewish population had to live in  ghettos and was systematically murdered in concentration camps afterwards.

##### 3. Were the Nuremberg Laws the main reason life was difficult for Jews in '29 - '39?

The Nuremberg Laws definitely played a role in further prohibiting Jewish life in Germany in the thirties, but I don't see them as the main reason for Jews to emigrate: The social exclusion of Jews, which was mainly carried out by boycotting shops and businesses owned by Jews, played a far bigger role in discrimination of the Jewish population.

##### 4. Explain two effects on Jews of the policy of setting up Ghettos

- Physical effects: e.g. starvation and disease spread by isolation of the Jewish population
- Mental effects: e.g. the feeling of segregation
